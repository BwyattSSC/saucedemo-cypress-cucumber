# SauceLabs Demo Utilizing Cypress and Cucumber Plugin

## Purpose

Repository provides a working example of using Cypress, Cucumber and the PageObject pattern. This is more so a technical exercise and not necessary promoting or discounting the pros/cons of using the page object pattern.

## Running test

1. npm install
2. `npx cypress open`
3. Select `E2E Testing`
4. Select `Chrome` and press `Start E2E Testing in Chrome`
5. Select the test script `cypress/e2e/LoginPage.feature`
6. Watch the test (hopefully) pass!

## TODO

- Plenty but TBD for now.
